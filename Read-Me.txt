This is the EchoAir MultiCopter, an 16-rotor helicopter, primary for medical and rescue missions.
#
This aircraft is based on the R44 by helijah, thanks to him
#
The FDM is exactly the one from the R44 by helijah, will be worked on soon.
#
RPM warning, rotor, "explosion", "flotteur", wind and overspeed sounds are taken from the R44 and made by "Baboon" (see Sounds/BaBoOn-R44-Sounds.html).
#
The bumpspec and glass effect has been taken from the ec135 and adapted.

HAVE FUN!
